# Bayesian-Machine-Learning-Project

By: Royal Wang

## Project Description

 A marketing offering is a product or service that a company provides to customers to meet their needs. The importance of marketing offerings is the ability to generate interest in your products and services through market deals or promotion. By developing products that align with your target market's needs and wants, you can increase your sales and promote brand loyalty among your customers. In order to know what product offerings would lead to a significant increase in profit, there must be a specified target market that appeals to what is being offered. A Bayesian model could provide accurate representation of random events based on demographic information in light of new data or evidence.
